- 👋 Hi, I’m @cding21
- 👀 I’m interested in backend technologies such as Kafka, Vertx and more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Modelling Complex Software Systems and Distributed Systems, which both utilise Java to model complex social problems and create unique applications such as a distributed whiteboard.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on Hack-a-thon projects and other related ideas
